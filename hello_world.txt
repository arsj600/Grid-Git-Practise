Op Sindoor had two objectives: 
1) hit terrorist bases in Pakistan & PoK. 9 bases were obliterated and objective achieved; 
2) to dominate the escalation ladder. Again, this objective was achieved because despite initial losses, 
India not only beat back Pakistani attacks but continued to escalate until the Punjabi generals begged for a ceasefire
 after their air force was grounded, their air bases dysfunctional, their command and control systems damaged, 
 their air defences taken out. The loss of a couple of aircraft is not the metric on basis of which Op Sindoor is to be judged.
 The achievement of the objective is the only metric to judge the success of the operation.
  To limit the entire clash to just the downing of a few aircraft is a travesty.
   It works for the Pakis who refuse to talk about what happened subsequently, the beating they got. 
   What followed was the grounding of the famed PAF, 
   the complete decimation of Turkish drones and the destruction of Chinese junk tech in air defences and radars. 
   All Indian platforms - Rafales, SU30s, the air defence system performed splendidly after the initial hiccups and
    caused enormous damage which forced the terrorist regime to sue for peace.
